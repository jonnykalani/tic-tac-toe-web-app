Process
I created a wireframe modeling a visual representation of how I thought an engaging web app would appear and behave.  The first task I tried to tackle was the game logic.  I figured it would be the hardest part because it seemed the most "mathy".  Weirdly enough, the game logic came super quickly.  I attribute it to the way I approached this problem, which was uncharacteristic of my typical methods.  I just decided to start at zero.  The game logic problem almost seemed insurmountable at first so I decided to just focus on what little I did know.  I knew that tic tac toe was a game that had specific and distinguishable winning conditions that could be defined succinctly and discreetly.  So i started there.  After a few hours of branching out from that starting point, I was able to designed the vast majority of the game logic that I needed for the project.

The so called 'valley' in my development journey came with the API requests.  I don't think I fully understood how the requests worked when we learned about them in class so it took me a disproportionate amount of time to do this part of the project.  I kept running into walls that would take hours to break down.  I kept secod guessing myself because my code wasn't working for hours, only to realize that my logic was actually sound and that there were tiny syntax errors that broke the function.  Part of me thought that I should be opening issues on github, but part of me thought that I could solve my own problems through reason and logic.  And in fact most of the time I was able to solve my own problems, but now I realize maybe for the sake of time management I should have done it more often.

I would have liked to have my app be more visually engaging and interactive.  I actually think I'll continue to work on this app and implement some of the things other cohort members did in their projects, such as retrieving specific past game data and alternative game types.

Development Materials
I used some of my user stories to guide my development process.  Examples include, "I want to be able to sign in under a unique user name and keep track of my personaly games," and "I want to be able to tell when I've won a game, or if the game is over.""
